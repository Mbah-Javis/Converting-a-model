# Converting-a-model
The difference between tfjs layers model and tfjs graph model is that tfjs layers supports both inference and training while tfjs graphs models support only inference
What is <strong>Inference</strong>?
<p>Inference refers to the process of using a trained machine learning algorithm to make a prediction. IoT(Internet of Things) data can be used as the input to a trained machine learning  model, enabling predictions that can guide decision logic on the device, at the edge gateway or elsewhere in the IoT system</p>

While <strong>Training</strong> is:
<p>Training refers to the process of creating an machine learning algorithm. Training involves the use of a deep-learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow) and training dataset. IoT data provides a source of training data that data scientists and engineers can use to train machine learning models for a variety of use cases, from failure detection to consumer intelligence</p>
